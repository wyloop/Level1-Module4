  # Pig Latin Translator


  We are going to make a translator (similar to Google translate) that converts English
  to Pig Latin.

  1. Make a UI that looks something like this:


  2. Using the PigLatinTranslator class in the package, create a program that:

  * Translates a word in English to Pig Latin when a button is pressed.

  * Translates a word in Pig Latin to English when a button is pressed.

  * Make the computer speak the Pig Latin phrase (using Sound.speak(words)) when a
  button is pressed.
